# Notes



* Chandan: reduce 4% of loss, with 2x extra reports.
    * 4% loss on aggregatable reports (by $)
    * Loss = 100 conversions in cookie word, we are getting 85 of them. Of the 15%, we understand 4% is coming from the delay (due to the debug reports).
    * Optimize by only using this feature for the most important features (not page views, etc). Checkout / conversions / etc. We can pay the cost of infra and reduce the loss.
* David
    * Didn’t quite hear that there is some first party data to identify if something should have a tuned up ‘importance’.
* Chandan
    * We call it ‘conversion type’. We use that as an annotation
    * This is a nice clean way to optimize. GAds can benefit
* David Dabbs
    * Timeline
* Charlie
    * I don’t think we have a fixed timeline, waiting for some positive feedback. Gonna try to scope the work. Will communicate back about the timeline.
    * Elective, downstream teams need to design the integration as well.

* Charlie
    * Want to get some feedback.
    * Go through the issue, add an optional field event-level_epsion to event-level source registration. Allows you to opt into a higher privacy stance than the browser allows.
    * Question to the group whether we see any value in having an opt -in API that allows you to get higher privacy.
    * Possibly integrate with permissions policy, the publisher can make sure that everyone is using this kind of epsilon.
* Aram
    * Setting the implementation for multiple browsers that might have different epsilon values. The reporting would become difficult to manage.
    * Desire to move towards this direction.
* Alexey 
    * Interoperable implementation between browsers
    * Hypothetical scenario, for future  this is probably implemented by other browsers.
* Charlie
    * Multiple vendors setting different epsilon values.
* Alexey:
    * No much interest from our site. Will not restrict ourselves on this.
* Charlie
    * I don’t think we’ve said too much about what’s the future plan. Even if we restrict the epsilon, we should probably keep the ability to specify the epsilon.
    * Be more private - probably not compelling yet.
    * Maybe we can integrate with publisher controls.
* David Dabbs
    * Yes… why not

* Anthony
    * Go over the issue
    * This limit was hit more frequently than anticipated.
    * First step towards mitigation is to increase the limit to 4096.
    * Also listened to feedback and ideas for other mitigation strategies.
    * Optimize how we enforce the limit.
        * Global limit to be used in parallel to the source limit.
    * Allow ad-techs to optimize the usage of the API, better mechanism so that they have less sources at a given time, and if they were to be dropped, there is better prioritization which source to drop.
* Chandan
    * Debug reports? 
        * Anthony: yes
        * ([https://wicg.github.io/attribution-reporting-api/#source-debug-data-type-source-storage-limit](https://wicg.github.io/attribution-reporting-api/#source-debug-data-type-source-storage-limit))
* Michael
    * Have you considered limits on separate limits of different types, navigate vs event.
    * Navigation is something that requires some directions from users, events doesn’t.
    * Navigation sources are much more important and valuable than event sources.
* Anthony
    * Good suggestion
    * Part of the optimization usage and allowing to choose which sources to drop.
* Charlie
    * If you add like flexible controls for prioritization about sources, ad-techs could encode by themselves in some sense.
    * Security risks. Right now the source limit is shared across ad-techs. This could potentially introduce some security issues. 
    * Malicious ad-techs spam a bunch of impressions.
    * Introducing more control may exacerbate that issue.
    * How to deal with this in the aspect of security change.
* Anthony
    * Partition the limit by reporting origin, so that each attack like this cannot affect other ad-techs. The main drawback is in practice you may have a lower number of sources, as the limit needs to be split between ad-techs.
    * Predictable so you know what you’re working with.
    * Follow up question: is this a trade-off would be of interest. A lower number of sources available, but going for sure that only used by you.
* Alexey
    * In favor of having a smaller number but a guaranteed one.
* David
    * Is it till 2026 that our debug reporting goes away or it goes away with cookies?
* Charlie
    * Debug reporting goes away with third-party cookies.
    * Have plan to replace with aggregate debug reporting
    * Source storage limit partition by ad-techs, proof that it doesn’t contain cross-site information. Tweak a little bit about the number, and not tell you anything about conversion patterns.
    * If privacy neutral, maybe keep sending this report even after 3pc deprecation.
    * Would anyone oppose to this? We don’t have numbers what the impact would be yet.
        * No

* Jon
    * Is there open-source code about this paper? 
* Charlie:
    * No
* Jon
    * Looking at two different angles, but same data.
    * What’s the best practice using these two APIs.
* Charlie
    * No promise this is the best way
* Jon
    * In page 20, it talks about how to leverage the hierarchical structure.
    * It reduces the noise impact.
    * In practice how we measure this, like automatically deploy two of them at the same time or would the upper summary report be different from the combined one.
    * How to deploy this in the API?
    * There are separate noises. 
* Charlie
    * The basic mechanism is to contribute a bucket to the histogram.
    * One event can contribute to multiple buckets.
    * A contribution split between those buckets.
* Charlie
    * Is it useful to have that paper published?
* Jon
    * Yes

Robert



* Have launched GCP beta aggregation service.
* Feedback appreciated.

David



* PR about spec changes for a queue

Nan



* This is mostly just a spec change, to make the spec more accurate and better reflect the implementation. We currently queue these events.
